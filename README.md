# How to grow your twitter (Parody)
This is a parody repository including all the "top guru advices" on how to increase followers and become a celebrity in Twitter.. so that eventually you can create a course around it and sell it to the vulnerables (Franky I am saving you a lot of bucks)

## why did I do this?
I am quite active in tech space in [twitter](https://twitter.com/sudip_post).  One common theme I keep seeing is a bunch of guys (tech evangelists with fancy, all inspiring) tweets and once they reach certain mark like 50k they almost always end up with a paid course on 'how to grow on twitter'. Such people reach those figures very inorganically (in couple months) and I have first hand experienced how they do it. So I am here to save you all the trouble.

### Disclaimer
This is not at all a disrespect to the genuine hustlers. (Please don't get offended. I am trying to help newcomers rather than discredit the fake gurus)

This will largely be for tech-space but some ideas could be generalized for other spaces as well.

- **Javascript is the answer.**  It's okay if it's not your primary language but start tweeting about javascript, especially about how cool it is and how anyone can learn it. (This is to cash in on the fact that most newcomers start off with javascript and this is the best way to connect/gain them)

- **Oversell the koolaid: Anyone can code** Though it's true anyone can code and become a programmer, just go ahead and oversell it. Lure all the newbies with this koolaid and make them believe its very lucrative. (Hide the struggles, hide the foundation required (actually you yourself don't have it, so it should be easy)).

- **You should have an inspirational story. (If not, fake it).** You dropped out of college and taught yourself how to code on weekends while doing a construction work during week. Main thing is you have to reinforce these facts every now and then

- **I scratch your back, you scratch mine.** Get connected to fellow aspiring fake-gurus. Compliment on each other's posts and give shoutout to each other. Make inspirational memes of each other. Creativity is the limit here.

- **Don't forget occasional tech tweets.** Don't make it so obvious that you are a total hack. So put out some tech tweets now and then. You have the whole internet to find something quirky. But don't get too technical (because you don't know shit).

- **Unsolicited tech advice is the silver bullet.** Do this, do that. Use this language, this framework and so on. Again these can just be regurgitated.

- **Start off your paid course.** Once you do this (remember it has to be as inorganic as possible.. 50k in 3 months is quite some benchmark, then you can boast about it and create a paid course on how to grow your business via twitter. (Here the business is again how to grow followers.. at this point you might want to do a refresher course on ***multilevel marketing*** Popular choices to host your courses are Udemy, gumroad.
